ldesc: "FreeTDS is a set of libraries for Unix and Linux that allows your
programs to natively talk to Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases.

Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation of the
TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by these databases for their own
clients. It supports many different flavors of the protocol and three
APIs to access it. Additionally FreeTDS works with other software such
as Perl and PHP, providing access from those languages as well."
